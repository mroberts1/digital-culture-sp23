Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.\n\nA key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as \"artificial intelligence\" or \"AI\"). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by \"art,\" or \"intelligence\" itself.\n\nA major theme of the course is the changing status of the **future** as a social imaginary. It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell's novel *1984* (1949) and films like *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Blade Runner* (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or *Soylent Green* (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as \"retrofutures\") have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.\n\n### Format\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n### **Outcomes**\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\n-   have a acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\n\n-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\n\n-   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\n\n-   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Texts\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\n\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks. You are encouraged to make use not only of print media but also of these screen-based and audio formats.\n\n[Adrian Hon](https://mssv.net/), *You've Been Played: How Corporations, Governments, and Schools Use Games to Control Us All*.

Open Topic Analysis (2 x 15%)**\n\nIndividual. Two short analytical essays 1,000 words in length (4 pages double-spaced, excluding bibliography) in response to course readings. Topics will be provided, although alternative topics may be arranged in consultation with the instructor. Submission deadlines: open.\n\n**2. Commentary (15%)**\n\nIndividual. Participation in weekly discussions of reading assignments. Each week, 2-3 students will be designated as discussion hosts for the week. Discussion hosting involves posting an initial reflective response on the reading assignments and then acting as moderators to the ensuing discussion.\n\n**3.ChatGPT (15%)**\n\nIndividual. Write a prompt for ChatGPT (or a similar language-based model) that generates a 500-word essay on a subject of your choice. (You will likely have to experiment with customizing the prompt in order to generate a satisfactory result.). Then write (do not generate) a 500-word reflection on the output from the prompt.\n\nRemember that this output is the result of pattern matching from very large datasets, not intelligence in the human sense; therefore, avoid vague speculations about whether ChatGPT can be considered as intelligent, or even sentient. Instead, evaluate the output purely **as if** it was written by a human subject. How satisfactory is it as a response to the prompt? What are its strengths, or blind spots? Can it pass for having been written by a human? If not, why not? Is it useful from a conceptual or analytical standpoint? If so, how?\n\n**4.Generative Art Gallery (15%)**\n\nIndividual. Using one of the systems focused on in the course (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion), submit one work that was generated using one of these systems. Images may be still or moving (e.g. animations, GIF loops, etc.)\n\nMultiples are acceptable, even encouraged. This work will be reviewed collectively by the group and displayed as a gallery, initally on Canvas, and later (with your permission) on the web.\n\n**5. Gamification Project (25%)**\n\nGroup project (2-3 students).\n\nDrawing on your reading of Adrian Hon's book *You've Been Played*, In consultation with your other group members, develop a gamification strategy for a product, service, organization, or institution of your choice. This may be a real, existing product, etc., or one that does not (yet) exist.\n\nWrite a proposal of approximately 1,000-1,500 words in length (4-6 pages, double-spaced) and prepare a presentation outlining the project that you have in mind: primary objectives, target audience, platforms used, game mechanics (how will people play it?), outcomes (points, rewards, badges, leaderboards, etc). Projects will be presented and discussed with the class during the last four meetings.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Bibliography\n\n\\[A\\] = audiobook ([Audible.com](http://audible.com/))\n\nBarthes, Roland. \"Rhetoric of the Image,\" in *Image Music Text*.
