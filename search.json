You can think of it like a large, interconnected network of Twitters, albeit without ads or data-collecting. Mastodon (like Pleroma) is basically software that enables anyone to set up their own social media server and host a community on it - you can even do it yourself. \nEach Mastodon community (more commonly known as an instance) has its own particular flavor, and there are communities in many languages. Each community also has its terms of service, that you should read carefully and observe.\nMastodon instances vary in size from just a handful of members to thousands. Many allow you to register a new account without approval, but for a lot you have to submit a registration request and may not be approved because some instances limit numbers to people who are referred by existing members. This is because communities typically have a very specific focus, whatever that may be. My own community, for example, is comprised mainly of coders, game designers, and digital artists. You can still read posts, though - if you’re interested, here’s my account page.\nInstances are connected with one another, so that you only need to set up an account on one. If you follow someone on a different instance, that person’s posts on that instance will appear in your feed on your instance - the federated model again.\nOf course, if people on one instance don’t like the community on another, for whatever reason, they can simply disconnect from it. So the affordances of instances, and the relations between them, are quite resilient against the usual abuses of social media like trolling, spamming, etc.\nChoosing an instance to register with may seem tricky at the beginning because there are so many! Take your time, and keep in mind that you can always switch instances later if you find another one that you like better - or just have multiple accounts on several instances (I have 5-6).\nAfter you join a community, just hang out there and see what goes on. Be sure to follow the account @feditips@mstdn.social, which has lots of useful tips about using Mastodon and other distributed services."

    "text": "Department of Visual & Media Arts\nEmerson College\nSpring Semester 2023\nTues/Thur 17 January—4 May 2023 6:00-7:45 p.m.\nAnsin 605\nDr. Martin Roberts\nOffice hrs: Thur 3:00-5:00 p.m.\nOffice: Ansin 915C\nYouTube playlist | Syllabus (outside Canvas)\n\n\n\n\n\nYouTube playlist | Mastodon Quickstart | \nModules: W1: Terminal Lucidity | W2: Lurking | W3: Alternate Timelines | W4: Black Twitter |\n\n\n\nThis course considers the nature and contemporary forms of digital culture. Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.\nA key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as “artificial intelligence” or “AI”). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by “art,” or “intelligence” itself.\nA major theme of the course is the changing status of the future as a social imaginary. It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell’s novel 1984 (1949) and films like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or Soylent Green (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as “retrofutures”) have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.\n\n\n\n\nThis course that examines the diverse range of cultural practices that use digital media and technology in a globally networked society. It also focuses on the automation of creative production by artificial intelligence systems and the implications that has on the meaning of art and intelligence. The passage also notes that the course will examine the changing perception of the future as a social imaginary, and how society’s focus on the past has affected our ability to imagine the future.\n\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\nhave a acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\nbe able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\nunderstand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\nhave reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks.

Alternate Timelines (15%)\nIndividual. Using the Alternative Timelines reading assignments as a model, write a short paper of 1,000 words in length (4 pages double-spaced, excluding bibliography) outlining your personal alternate timeline of the internet.\n2. Open Topic Analysis Paper (15%)\nIndividual. Short paper analysis (1,000 words, 4 pages double-spaced) on any of the topics discussed in the course to date (Week 12)\n3. Discussion forums (20%)\nIndividual. One or more discussion posts per week on reading assignments, submitted anytime during the week of the assignments in question. A minimum of ten weekly posts is required.\n4. ChatGPT (15%)\nIndividual. Write a prompt for ChatGPT (or a similar language-based model) that generates a 500-word essay on a subject of your choice. (You will likely have to experiment with customizing the prompt in order to generate a satisfactory result.). Then write (do not generate) a 500-word reflection on the output from the prompt.\nRemember that this output is the result of pattern matching from very large datasets, not intelligence in the human sense; therefore, avoid vague speculations about whether ChatGPT can be considered as intelligent, or even sentient. Instead, evaluate the output purely as if it was written by a human subject. How satisfactory is it as a response to the prompt? What are its strengths, or blind spots? Can it pass for having been written by a human? If not, why not? Is it useful from a conceptual or analytical standpoint? If so, how?\n5.Generative Art Gallery (15%)\nIndividual. Using one of the systems focused on in the course (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion), submit one work that was generated using one of these systems. Images may be still or moving (e.g. animations, GIF loops, etc.)\nMultiples are acceptable, even encouraged. This work will be reviewed collectively by the group and displayed as a gallery, initally on Canvas, and later (with your permission) on the web.\n6. Gamification Project (20%)\nGroup project (2-3 students).\nDrawing on your reading of Adrian Hon’s book You’ve Been Played, in consultation with your other group members, develop a gamification strategy for a product, service, organization, or institution of your choice. This may be a real, existing product, etc., or one that does not (yet) exist.\nWrite a proposal of approximately 1,000-1,500 words in length (4-6 pages, double-spaced) and prepare a presentation outlining the project that you have in mind: primary objectives, target audience, platforms used, game mechanics (how will people play it?), outcomes (points, rewards, badges, leaderboards, etc). Projects will be presented and discussed with the class during the last four meetings.\n\n\n\n[A] = audiobook (Audible.com)\nBarthes, Roland. “Rhetoric of the Image,” in Image Music Text.

But have you heard of lurking? Like that other obsolete 1990s term, cyberspace, the term lurking seems to have fallen into disuse these days, even though as a practice it’s still very much around. I don’t mind admitting, though, that I more or less decided to assign Joanne McNeill’s recent book Lurking almost on the strength of its title alone, because that one word alone told me everything I needed to know about its content. As it happens, Joanne and I belong to almost the same internet generation—the one that discovered the internet (then spelt with an upper-case ‘I,’ as was the usage then) and the web (then known by the quaintly adorable “World Wide Web,” still reproduced in the www of URL addresses) in the early 1990s, through WIRED magazine and Mondo 2000, when we were talking about cyberspace and what Howard Rheingold had named virtual communities, when the term browser was new. Before Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, I remember using Mosaic and Netscape. I began coding websites for my courses in raw HTML, before Javascript and CSS existed. While they look hokey by today’s standards, some of those websites are still around a quarter of a century later; I wonder how many of today’s Javascript-based Wordpress blogs will still be accessible twenty five years from now in 2047.\nThese were the days of Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) and 12-baud dialup connections. We used Gopher for search, a text-based browser called Lynx (get it?), and telnet to remote-login to servers. We would hang out in “text-based virtual reality systems” called “MUDs” (an acronym for Multi-User Dungeons or Dimensions, a kind of online counterpart to Dungeons & Dragons board game), or more socially oriented MOOs (MUD, Object-Oriented—an acronym containing an acronym). I’m familiar with most of the references that McNeill discusses in her second chapter (“Anonymity”), from Stacy Horn’s ECHO community to the article by Julian Dibbell, the first—but certainly not the last—account of online sexual harrasment. I read Dibbell’s article when it was published in the Village Voice, and invited him to participate in a forum I organized called “Democracy in Cyberspace” (I’m planning to put the transcript back up online soon, if possible before the end of the course).\nI decided to assign Lurking because for all you millennials and Gen-Zers too young to remember it, I wanted you to read about the history of social media before social media (at least in chapter 2; as you’ll have seen, chapter 4 covers the more recent and more familiar territory of the iPhone, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr)—to give you an idea of what internet culture looked like in the 1990s, and how it anticipated in many ways the social media world of today. In fact, a surprising amount of that culture has persisted right up to the present, even though it’s been completely eclipsed by the rise of mobile-based social media platforms over the past fifteen years. There continues to be, for example, a thriving community around the text-based Gopher protocol; there’s even an iOS Gopher app. So-called “modern” browsers like Chrome don’t support it, although you can get extensions enabling you to access it.\nLurking, of course, has also not gone away. Entering the same question that ECHO asked its readers several decades ago, “Why do you lurk?” shows that lurking is by no means an obsolete practice dating back to UseNet newsgroups and CompuServe chat rooms: the Reddit Twitch group discusses it, for example, while the question is discussed in relation to many other platforms—try typing the question into Google and you’ll see what I mean. Yet at the same time, the contemporary meaning of lurking itself seems to have changed: asking the question “Why do you lurk?” today seems almost confrontational, as if it’s something that you’re not supposed to be doing: in a networked media environment in which participation and “sharing” have become a social obligation, lurking seems an object of suspicion. After all, in a communication environment in which the business model of SM platforms is based on advertising, this requires that users (another term that McNeill puts under the microscope in the book’s introduction) identify themselves so that their demographic can be more efficiently targeted. From that standpoint, lurkers are simply refusing to play the game. So the question that this is leading up to—if you haven’t already guessed!—is very simple: what’s your own position on lurking? Are you a lurker? Where and why do you lurk? (Of course, only share what you’re comfortable with!) Is lurking a legitimate form of engagement on social media platforms, or should it be banned (i.e. access to content is conditional on posting oneself)? Why has lurking, or admitting to lurking, become almost a form of social stigma in a world where public self-disclosure is expected as a form of responsible citizenship?\nAs for McNeill’s “Sharing” chapter, I wonder what people make of a couple of her points. The first is about the snobbery of cultural critics in their hostility to “the internet,” even while actually knowing very little about it: as she notes, “A cliché marker of writerly genius in magazine profiles at the time was that the ‘author doesn’t carry a phone’ or ‘doesn’t use the internet.’’’ For a recent example of this kind of critique, see [this excerpt](The Digital Age is Destroying Us ‹ Literary Hub from the cultural theorist Jonathan Crary’s recent book Scorched Earth.\nA second question is in connection with McNeill’s anecdote about Winona Ryder saying to Jimmy Fallon in 2011 that she was terrified of Google, which illustrates “how hard it is to feel in control as a user.” Do you too get that sense of a loss of control in your experience of social media? What forms does this loss of control take today? What can be done about it?\nAll of which brings us, finally, to Twitter. Leaving aside the obsessive focus on the platform on Musk himself and the series of desperate and distastrous policy decisions since he acquired the platform, we may currently find ourselves in the privileged position of observing in real time the implosion and collapse of a social media platform, a once-in-a-lifetime event akin to witnessing a supernova or a passing comet. But the apparently imminent demise of Twitter, evidenced by the overnight halving of its workforce and the exodus from the platform to the open-source platforms of the fediverse, might prove to be the first in a series of such events. A couple of days ago, the internet researcher Zizi Papacharisi tweeted:\n\nHere’s a thought.\nPlatforms are over.\n\nOne thing that’s clear from the past three decades, as Friendster and MySpace exemplify, is that social media platforms have a limited lifecycle. After Twitter, when can we expect the implosion of Facebook/Meta? And how long before TikTok burns itself into a white dwarf? Are the days of the social media platform itself numbered, as Papacharisi suggests?\nAs the red giants of the social media firmament seem to be on the brink of burning themselves out, the 90s-era internet continues very much as it has done for the past quarter century and longer. Other than the Gopher holdouts (one of whom is a friend of mine), there’s a revival of interest in decentralized, open-source, free (as in beer) software, decades-old communication systems like Internet Relay Chat, and communities emerging around protocols completely outside the web, like Gemini. To get a sense of what’s out there in terms of these alternative communities, both old and relatively new, take a look at the SDF Public Access UNIX System (aka PubNIX) community, which I’m a member of), or the decentralized, rapidly-expanding constellation known as the fediverse."
