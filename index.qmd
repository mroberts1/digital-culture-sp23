### Overview

This course considers the nature and contemporary forms of digital culture. Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.

A key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as "artificial intelligence" or "AI"). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by "art," or "intelligence" itself.

A major theme of the course is the changing status of the **future** as a social imaginary. It has been suggested that while we live today in the futures imagined by writers and filmmakers since George Orwell's novel *1984* (1949) and films like *2001: A Space Odyssey* (1968), *Blade Runner* (1982, set in 2019 and later 2049), or *Soylent Green* (1973, set in 2022), postmodern society has become so absorbed in commemorating its own past that it has become incapable of imagining its own future, dystopian or otherwise. As the course shows, historical projections of the future (often referred to as "retrofutures") have paradoxically themselves become objects of postmodernist nostalgia.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ChatGPT summary

This course that examines the diverse range of cultural practices that use digital media and technology in a globally networked society. It also focuses on the automation of creative production by artificial intelligence systems and the implications that has on the meaning of art and intelligence. The passage also notes that the course will examine the changing perception of the future as a social imaginary, and how society's focus on the past has affected our ability to imagine the future.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Format

This is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will:

-   have a acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;
-   be able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;
-   understand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;
-   have reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.

### Assignments & Evaluation

**1. Alternate Timelines (15%)**

Individual. Using the Alternative Timelines reading assignments as a model, write a short paper of 1,000 words in length (4 pages double-spaced, excluding bibliography) outlining your personal alternate timeline of the internet.

**2. Open Topic Analysis Paper (15%)**

Individual. Short paper analysis (1,000 words, 4 pages double-spaced) on any of the topics discussed in the course to date (Week 12)

**3. Discussion forums (20%)**

Individual. One or more discussion posts per week on reading assignments, submitted anytime during the week of the assignments in question. A minimum of ten weekly posts is required.

**4. ChatGPT (15%)**

Individual. Write a prompt for ChatGPT (or a similar language-based model) that generates a 500-word essay on a subject of your choice. (You will likely have to experiment with customizing the prompt in order to generate a satisfactory result.). Then write (do not generate) a 500-word reflection on the output from the prompt.

Remember that this output is the result of pattern matching from very large datasets, not intelligence in the human sense; therefore, avoid vague speculations about whether ChatGPT can be considered as intelligent, or even sentient. Instead, evaluate the output purely **as if** it was written by a human subject. How satisfactory is it as a response to the prompt? What are its strengths, or blind spots? Can it pass for having been written by a human? If not, why not? Is it useful from a conceptual or analytical standpoint? If so, how?

**5.Generative Art Gallery (15%)**

Individual. Using one of the systems focused on in the course (DALL-E 2, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion), submit one work that was generated using one of these systems. Images may be still or moving (e.g. animations, GIF loops, etc.)

Multiples are acceptable, even encouraged. This work will be reviewed collectively by the group and displayed as a gallery, initally on Canvas, and later (with your permission) on the web.

**6. Gamification Project (20%)**

Group project (2-3 students).

Drawing on your reading of Adrian Hon's book *You've Been Played*, in consultation with your other group members, develop a gamification strategy for a product, service, organization, or institution of your choice. This may be a real, existing product, etc., or one that does not (yet) exist.

Write a proposal of approximately 1,000-1,500 words in length (4-6 pages, double-spaced) and prepare a presentation outlining the project that you have in mind: primary objectives, target audience, platforms used, game mechanics (how will people play it?), outcomes (points, rewards, badges, leaderboards, etc). Projects will be presented and discussed with the class during the last four meetings.
